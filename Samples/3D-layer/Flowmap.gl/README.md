# Flowmap.gl Sample

A simple setup to bundle the `src/flowmap.gl.js` source file with Vite.

## Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Install
```bash
npm install
````

## Build

Bundle only the source JS file and generate a fixed output name:

```bash
npm run build
```

The built file will be located at `dist/flowmap.bundle.js` and is imported in the `Flowmap.gl.html` file.

## Development / Test

Build the source JS file and start a local server to test the `Flowmap.gl.html` file.
